This is a very standard Rails 6 app that allows users to search for countries and locations to kiteboard. There are basic user accounts, and the ability to calculate the closest listed kiteboarding locations to you. Searching is by name (of KiteSpot or Country) or by tag (month, local amenities).

There is also an administrate-based dashboard that allows all the typical CRUD actions on the basic models.
