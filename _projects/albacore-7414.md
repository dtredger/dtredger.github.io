This hull from 1986 hasn't been on the water in years, but was formerly fast. It appears to be in good shape, but the state of the hull is unknown. There is minor cracking just below the gunwale (suggesting the boat has dried out), and some dark spots on the transom.

The work to be done is:

- Remove all hull fittings;
- Strip paint, fiberglass, and epoxy from the hull;
- Epoxy, Fiberglass (vacuum bag), and paint (hull and bottom separately);
- Remove deck fittings and control lines;
- Strip varnish and epoxy from interior;
- Re-epoxy exposed wood, then re-varnish;
- Install extra gunwale supports;
- Measure fitting placement against class rules;

Currently a work-in-progress, with target to launch in spring 2024.
