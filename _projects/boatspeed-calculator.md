This repository is a **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing basic calculations of **Velocity Made Good (VMG)** for the most 
efficient way to sail to a given destination.

The notebook also includes the wind polar graph of a **Figaro 3**, as well as a generic wave polar (which provides the % of best performance achievable in a given sea-state)
